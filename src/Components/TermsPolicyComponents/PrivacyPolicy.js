            Welcome to DrinkPartyCan.com (“Site”), a website maintained and operated by Three Tier Solution Inc. (“Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”). Three Tier Solution offers a white-label enterprise solution for liquor brands (“our Customers”) to enable e-commerce. Three Tier Solution’s advanced API integrates directly with our Customers’ websites, connecting our Customers with localized retailers (“Retailers”) that deliver directly to consumers (“Consumers”). Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and share your personal information and to assist you in exercising the privacy rights available to you. By using or accessing the Site, you signify your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>

                          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us in our business, as collected on our website, from the employees of our business-to-business customers and other related online or offline offerings (collectively, the “Services”).
                          </p>

                          <p>
            Consumers visit our Customers’ websites and provide information via the Three Tier Solution enterprise solution that is needed to fulfill e-commerce transactions for products and services. Retailers who agree to participate in Three Tier Solution’s platform will receive limited information about Consumers only as needed to deliver those products and services. This limited information includes name, address, and contact information such as phone number or email for both the purchasers and the recipient, if the purchase is intended as a gift for another person. Three Tier Solution also receives additional information from Consumers, such as product preferences, to enable Consumers to identify products or services for purchase during their shopping experience. The Three Tier Solution enterprise solution is governed by our customers’ Privacy Policies. Our Customers are responsible for providing the appropriate notice to their end-clients (Consumers) and obtaining any required authorizations to permit us to further process the personal information. We encourage you to read each of our Customer’s privacy policies in detail.

These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third party websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to share information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.</p>
